# MR tic tac toe pseudocode


# For loop a list to make the tic tac toe board
# def print_board(board)
    #[1,2,3]
    #[4,5,6]
    #[7,8,9]
    # print the board choices so the user can choose where to put their first mark
# The player can only input an x so there has to be an if True statement to check what they are inputting
    # If the input is invalid tell the user to "try again!"
    # print the board and the choices on where to put the X.
# use random.choice() to choose the choice of the computer on where to put the O on the board


# print both the players and the computers choices


# If user choose to put the X in 1
    #print the board with the 1 marked off
    # print the choice of the computer which is random
# Once a choice is taken on the board it can not be used again.
# We need to make sure the the choice of the computer is different from the users choice
# You want to make an elif statement that checks on where the user and computer put their choices
