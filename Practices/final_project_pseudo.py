# The options will be LeBron James, Lola Bunny, and Daffy Duck.
# We will make other variables that establish the stats of all the players.
# No matter what character they choose they will have the same stats but they have different abilities
# VARIABLES

#Bugs Bunny: {}
#Tweety: {}
#Granny: {}
#LeBron James: {}
