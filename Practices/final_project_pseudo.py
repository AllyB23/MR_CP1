# MR 2nd Final Project Pseudocode
# We Will welcome the user into the game
# Print("Welcome to Serverse Showdown!")
# "Welcome to Serververse Showdown. The game has been hacked, the players are missing, and it's up to you to assemble the ultimate team and reclaim the court. Ready to play for a chance at freedom?"
# We will explain the plot of the game using print statements
# EXPLANATION
# We will give the user a variable named Character so they can choose what character to be from the three options
# The options will be LeBron James, Lola Bunny, and Daffy Duck.
# We will make other variables that establish the stats of all the players.
# No matter what character they choose they will have the same stats but they have different abilities
# VARIABLES
#Lola Bunny: {}
#Bugs Bunny: {}
#Tweety: {}
#Granny: {}
#LeBron James: {}
#Daffy Duck: {}
#Porky Pig: {}
# Inside of the characters dictionaries we will put these variables:
""" Basketball_IQ:[]
    Stamina/Durability:[]
    Looney_Ablilities:[]
    Strength:[]
    Speed:[]
    Shooting:[]
    """

# The user can basically choose what world or room is there starting one because there is not a set starting point
# They will have the option to go to whatever world they like from the random 3 that they are given
# User input to ask them what world they would like to go to
# IF statements to decide which world to travel because they only have the the option of 3 to choose from
# IF character = 1 go to Earth
# Elif character = 2 go to 
# DEF Earth():
    # If the character is LeBron James then they start out on earth so we will make an if statement out of the function to lead the player here
    # After that we will ask them to what world they want to to next using a user input
    # We will check earth if there is any players to recruit 
    # If there is none return False
