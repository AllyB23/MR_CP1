# MR 2nd Maze generator
# first we will import turtle and random
import turtle
import random
#we have to set the variables for the grid columns and the grid rows
grid_rows = []
grid_columns = 6
start_point = (0,0)
end_point = (6,6)

# we need at least 3 functions
# the first functions will be to randomly generate the grid columns with random open spaces in them
def 

# In the function we will make a nested loop for the grid rows to be randomized with random spaces in them
# the second function will check if the maze is solvable
# the functions will be checkin gid we have a starting point and if we have an end point
# the functions will use the path coordinates to check the correct wall coordinates in each direction
# after we make all the functions and set the variables we have to make a turtle
# we will use turtle to draw the maze
# we will code all the turtle setting so it looks like it is drawing the maze
# turtle always has to move the same way but if it over runs then we have to check that\
